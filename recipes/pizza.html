            <li>2 tsp coarse salt</li>
            <li>600g canned whole peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp coarse salt</li>
            <li>Pinch dried chilli flakes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Pizza Toppings</p>

        <ul>
            <li>200g shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>300g fior di latte (thinly sliced)</li>
            <li>Basil leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>To make the pizza dough, place the flour, salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the dough hook, mix to combine. Add the water and knead on low speed for 5 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Transfer the dough to a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to proof in a warm, draft-free place for 2 hours, or until doubled in size.

            <br>

            [Tip: If you have a Sage oven with a proof function; set to 30°C and proof for 1 hour.]</li>

            <br>

            <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured bench top and divide into 4 even pieces, approximately 240g each. Shape each piece into a smooth ball.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Sprinkle a proofing box or deep sided container with semolina. Place the dough balls in the box, leaving 10cm between them. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to 5 days.</li>

            <br>

            <li>An hour before cooking, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Meanwhile, make the pizza sauce.</li>

            <br>

            <li>To make the pizza sauce, place the tomatoes, oil, garlic, oregano, salt and chilli flakes (if using), in a large jug. Process with an immersion blender until smooth.</li>

            <br>

            <li>About 20 minutes before the dough has finished resting, preheat the oven. Select the Wood Fired setting. Turn the Darkness dial to the Darker setting and select 2 minutes on the Timer dial.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Once preheated, sprinkle semolina on the bench top. Place one of the dough balls on the bench top and sprinkle with semolina. Keep the remaining dough covered to prevent it from drying out. Gently press out the dough working from the centre into a 26cm round, leaving a 1cm border. Lightly sprinkle the pizza peel with semolina. Carefully transfer the dough onto the pizza peel.</li>

            <br>

            <li>For each pizza, leaving a small border, top with a quarter each of the pizza sauce, mozzarella and fior di latte.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Place the pizza in the oven, press the Timer dial and cook for 2 minutes, or until the crust is spotted brown and the cheese has melted.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Transfer to a cutting board, scatter with basil leaves and slice to serve.</li>

        </ol>
