Whether you're using classic white bread and American cheese or mixing it up with sourdough and sharp cheddar, the core idea stays the same. Crispy on the outside, melty on the inside, and irresistibly satisfying.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Sourdough bread</li>
            <li>Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sharp cheddar</li>
            <li>Gruyère</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li><u>Prep the Bread</u>: Spread mayonnaise on the outer sides of each bread slice—skip the butter for this one. Mayo helps the bread crisp up beautifully in the skillet and adds a deeper, more savory flavor. On the inside of one slice, spread a thin layer of Dijon mustard for a little extra tang.</li>

            <br>

            <li><u>Add the Cheese</u>: Pile on grated cheese over the mustard-covered slice. Grating helps the cheese melt evenly and quickly. If you're using a soft cheese like brie, go ahead and slice it instead. Aim for about 1 to 2 ounces per type of cheese. Top with the second slice of bread, keeping the mayo-coated side facing out.</li>

            <br>

            <li><u>Choose Your Pan</u>: A cast-iron skillet is ideal for achieving that perfect, golden crust. Don’t worry if you don’t have one—nonstick works in a pinch too.</li>

            <br>

            <li><u>Cook Low and Slow</u>: Set your heat to medium-low. High heat will toast the bread too fast and leave the cheese unmelted.</li>

            <br>

            <li><u>Cover While Cooking</u>: Lightly butter the skillet to coat the bottom. Place the sandwich in the pan and cover it with a lid. This traps steam, helping the cheese melt while the bread toasts. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until golden, then flip and cook the other side—again, covered.</li>

            <br>

            <li><u>Adjust as Needed</u>: If the bread is browning too quickly, lower the heat to avoid burning before the cheese finishes melting.</li>

            <br>

            <li><u>Serve It Up</u>: Once both sides are crisp and the inside is gooey, remove the sandwich from the pan. Slice it—triangles are tradition—and serve hot!</li>

        </ol>
