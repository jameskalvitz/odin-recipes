        <p>
            There’s nothing like a good cheeseburger, and this recipe keeps it simple and delicious. Start with ground beef seasoned just right, cook it up to juicy perfection, and top it off with a slice of melty cheese. Add your favorite toppings—lettuce, tomato, pickles, maybe some grilled onions—and sandwich it all between a toasted bun. It’s the kind of burger that hits the spot every single time.

        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <p><u><b>Patties:</b></u></p>
            <li>Separate the beef into 4 equal portions. Gently roll each portion into balls then press down into round patties that are slightly larger than your bun to allow for shrinkage</li>
            
            <br>

            <p><u><b>Prepare:</b></u></p>
            <li>Get all your burger bits and pieces out and ready to use. Don't salt your beef until just before cooking (it toughens the meat).</li>

            <br>

             <p><u><b>Toast buns:</b></u></p>
            <li>Preheat the grill to high. Place the bread cut face up on a tray and toast for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. Set aside.</li>

            <br>

             <p><u><b>Dent patty:</b></u></p>
            <li>Sprinkle one side of patties with half the salt and pepper. Flip, then press a dent into the middle of each patty. (Prevents patties doming when cooking and reduces shrinkage!). Sprinkle this dented side with the remaining salt and pepper.</li>

            <br>

            <p><u><b>Preheat:</b></u></p>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot - smoking hot!</li>

            <p><u><b>Cook:</b></u></p>
            <li>Cook 2 to 4 patties (whatever fits in the pan) for 1 1/2 minutes. Press down lightly with a spatula (not too hard else the meat juices squeeze out!). Flip, then immediately top with a slice of cheese. Cook for another 1 1/2 minutes (cheese will melt by itself!) then transfer burgers to a tray to rest for 3 minutes.</li>

            <p><u><b>Assemble:</b></u></p>
            <li>Slather the base of the bun with your sauce of choice. My order of assembly: lettuce, tomato, burger (x 2 for double!), gherkins, onion, sauce on bun lid, jam it on top of the stack.</li>

        </ol>
